King Richards is a good biographical drama film that gives Will Smith to shine with an outstanding performance. And making this film one heartfelt story about Richard Williams (Will Smith) who is raising his two daughters Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena (Demi Singleton) and plotting a life course of a successful professional tennis player path.

What Worked? It is a strong and heartfelt story. Richard plotting a path for his two daughters to become professional tennis players. It is strong. Richard is brilliant and stubborn. He even rejects professional tennis coach offers cause he felt like they were not right for his daughters. Which is a huge risk rejection. Of course things fall into place when he comes across Rick (Jon Bernthal). The story is good.

Will Smith delivers with another outstanding performance. Which he is a good actor. When he is on screen as Richard, he literally displays a whole different character on screen. Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton were both great with there characters. Aunjanue Ellis playing Brandy, there mother was also good. Jon Bernthal playing Rick who tries to lead the girl in a right path as a coach was also good.

What did not work? I felt like the film does have a little uneven pacing with its direction.

Overall, it is one strong emotional heartfelt story that will shine of seeing two rising tennis players becoming the famous players today.
