Resident Evil: Welcome to Racoon City is a solid attempt at a more faithful adaptation of the game that definitely has its moments and some satisfyingly accurate recreations but still has too many problems and lacks both the fear and genuine horror to be a truly definitive adaptation.

It takes way too long to really get going and then abruptly ends making it feel extremely rushed. The exposition is extremely clunky and feels unnatural in the dialogue. It also makes some interesting changes but doesn't really do anything with them.

Kaya Scodelario, Hannah John-Kamen, Robbie Amell, Tom Hopper and Avan Jogia all give good performances but none them truly embody their iconic characters. Avan comes the closest but Donal Logue gives the best performance overall.

Johannes Roberts direction is pretty good, it's mostly well filmed, there's a clear love for the games present and there's an impressive dedication to practical effects. However, it's almost completely reliant on ineffective jump scares and has some awful CG. The music by Mark Korven is really good and the soundtrack is also good.
