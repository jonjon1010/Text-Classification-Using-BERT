"Dune" is a great book and it, along with its sequels, are compelling reading. However, they are NOT short nor light reading and to make a decent version of the first book, it's hard to imagine doing anything other than making a mini-series. This was one of several reasons why I hated the David Lynch version from 1984. It crammed so much stuff into such a short film that it often was confusing....and the director himself hated the film. Apparently, the studio took the movie away from him and hacked it to pieces...thus making it so confusing. Because of this, I was not interested in seeing this 2021 version....until I learned it was only part one and the second film would complete the first "Dune" book.

So, from the outset, this film can't help but be better than the 1984 version. BUT, it manages to do something I didn't expect...it's actually TOO long...or so it felt due to the pacing and ridiculous number of big scenes were not much happens but you see a lot of eye candy...along with very moody music. In many ways, it reminded me of the first "Star Trek" movie...which was so long and tedious...and had too many scenes where you just see a ship flying through space! And, in "Dune: Part One" there are too many scenes like this and not enough emotion and dialog. In other words, it seems to need a more personal and human tough to make it a truly great film. Now I am not saying it's bad or to avoid it. But the film could have been tightened up a bit and paced better.

Fortunately, if you have never read "Dune", this film is approachable and does follow the book closely.
