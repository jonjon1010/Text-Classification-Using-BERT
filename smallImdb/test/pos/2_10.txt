Newly retired James Bond and bride Madeleine are enjoying scenic travelling despite the secrets they both know the other has. Those secrets blow the couple apart and Bond goes off the grid until - well, reasons.

It is difficult to give much plot commentary without risking spoilers and, of all the Bonds, this has more potential for spoilers than any of them. So let me mention specific but non-plot items.

The opening sequence is the most genuinely chilling sequence in any Bond film. The multiple nods to previous Bond - both books and films (dialogue, music, set design etc.) - are affectionate and organic rather than knowing nudges. New director Cary Joji Fukanaga shows that Sam Mendes doesn't have a monopoly on making Bond movies look gorgeous. Lea Seydoux, reprising an underwritten Madeleine, is spectacularly good. Ana De Armas features in a sequence which is huge fun, but it's not too difficult to recognise that it was shoehorned in at a late stage, because 2 lines of dialogue would have sufficed to replace it in the story.

And perhaps it is fair to comment that a feature of the Craig Bonds has been each film revealing another layer like nesting Russian dolls, and the baddie here has an air of being added to extend the saga after an effective full ending at the conclusion of Spectre. But I'm not complaining because, following Craig's decision to OK, I'll do another one but no more, this is a good, good end to his five Bond films.

And I'm now prepared to say that his Bond is the best screen Bond. My reason for this is that his is the only Bond who has been a human being - capable of cold suppression of emotion in order to do his job, but a real person nonetheless. The other Bonds have all been actors playing characters.

I choked up at the music choice over the closing credits.
