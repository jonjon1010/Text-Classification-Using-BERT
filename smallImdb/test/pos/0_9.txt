Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.

But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.

I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.

It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).

Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema! Well done!
