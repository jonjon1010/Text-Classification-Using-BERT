Venom is getting tired of chicken and chocolate. He wants human brains but Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) resists. Both are eager to get back together with Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) but she's marrying Dan. Serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) invites Eddie to a visit before his execution. Venom attack Cletus who takes a bite transforming him into Carnage.

This is the second Venom movie with Tom Hardy. I like Venom and Tom Hardy's chemistry. Michelle Williams needs to bring down her guard. It's her character work because when she actually relax, they have lots of fun. At her best, she's like Mrs. Chen and that's good. The main drawback is the chaotic visuals and the limitations of the villains. Frances is one-dimensional when she could be more. As for the chaos, it's the comic book material and I don't know if anything can be done about that.
