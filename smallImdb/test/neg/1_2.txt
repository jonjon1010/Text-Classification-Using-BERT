I enjoyed Anderson's past films, but this one was such a godawful disappointment that I have to warn you: don't waste your money on this shallow, lazy movie. It's a shame to see Anderson fall off so badly. A lot of people have brand loyalty to Anderson as a Hollywood name, but if you care about a film's actual merits, you'll be happier watching one of the French New Wave or black-and-white classics that Anderson cheesily references in this aimless, mindless consumer product.

The kindest phrase for this movie is "half-baked." It's divided into three stories, each narrated by a different writer from the titular news journal. Dividing a film into three smaller stand-alone stories is a new approach for Anderson, and he botched it pathetically. He has enough content and ideas for three 10-minute stories, but instead he stretched them each out to 3 times that length, without adding any depth or substance.

To make things worse, you spend the entire movie listening to pompous, vapid characters narrating and trying way too hard to sound clever. If Anderson had combined the writers into a single character, maybe this role could've had some depth, but instead the film is dominated by three paper-thin characters who all talk like a college freshman wannabe-author. So this movie isn't just awkwardly paced, it's annoying as all getout. If someone told me this script was the first draft with no revisions or improvements, I'd believe them.

It really feels like Wes Anderson wrote a big notebook of ideas, then he just adapted it into a film. Instead of deciding on a key story or theme and asking "what can I add that will make it stronger," Anderson just asked "wouldn't I look totally clever if..." and piled on the gimmicks. The first story is about a mad artist and the art dealer who profits from his work. Do we learn what makes the artist tick? Does the film make us feel any strong emotions about him? Are we supposed to care about the art dealer's greed? No, of course not. The point of the segment is just "look at this art dealer promoting the madman's work! Isn't that just so quirky?" And that might have been fine at half the length, but the segment drags this one-note idea on and ON, hitting you over the head with the same concept long after it's gotten old.

The story BRIEFLY toys with heavier ideas, touching on the cruelty of the madman and his sorrow at being imprisoned for life, but it also has cartoonishly silly ideas that are just plain stupid, such as a prisoner routinely bribing a fat guard with candy. The silly parts seem to be Anderson's way of saying "don't take any of it too seriously!" which gives him a cheap excuse to avoid making any worthwhile point.

The second story is even worse, about students from a private school rebelling against the faculty, then the entire city. First the boys simply demand that the school allow them to visit the girls' dorm. But then they form a huge youth movement that clearly wants something bigger... but the movie never bothers to explain their new goal. What are the stakes? How are we supposed to sympathize with these characters?

You could argue that the segment is a satire about "rebels without a cause," but the film never makes any point about the teens' naivety. The rebels are mostly a bunch of obnoxious pseudo-intellectual teens (accompanied by an equally flaky journalist) who never shut up, and Anderson seems to think they're really cool and entertaining. It honestly feels like something a sheltered teen would write, and I assume that's the target audience here.

This segment is so stupid, it doesn't even have a plot. There's a hasty last-second line about the youth movement splitting into factions and collapsing, but this means absolutely nothing since the script is too lazy to flesh out what the different students actually wanted. It's like an amateurish student film, awkward and incredibly lazy but convinced it's clever.

The first couple segments also feature some of Anderson's aloof women who act like robotic aliens. In past films, Anderson has had some steely women whose relatable depths and complexities become clear as we watch them, but in this movie, the characters are total cardboard cutouts. The prison guard in the "mad artist" segment is the worst offender; she's directed as a robot, plain and simple. It's always been clear that some immature part of Anderson still views women as "strange foreign creatures," and it is embarrassingly clear in this film.

But at least his women do active and dynamic things in the story. In the third segment, Anderson self-consciously points out that the writer is gay, and so, despite being a very wealthy, successful, extremely respected, and highly privileged man, the character is a passive wimp who doesn't take any action in his own story. The character is clearly confident about his sexuality, mentioning it casually in his public articles, but Anderson adds a scene where this highly privileged man (in a city where most people are shown to be poor and struggling) mopes about being gay and misunderstood. In this film, Anderson doesn't bother showing any sympathy for the gaunt streetwalkers who have to sell their bodies just to survive, but he has to stereotype the gay man as weak, pitiful, and ineffectual, no matter how obviously empowered the guy actually is. Anderson's attempt at open-mindedness just reveals his own insulting prejudice, not to mention his disregard for the suffering of the poor while the wealthy praise themselves.

Without a good story or sincere concepts to explore, all Anderson has is his stable of gimmicks. And when he trots them out over and over, you begin to realize what an annoying and flimsy crutch they really are.

Everything about this movie is shallow, underdeveloped, and half-baked. Some shots make references to classic old films, but so what? If you reference good movies in your lazy, twee, forgettable movie, you just make your audience wish they were watching one of those original films.

Do yourself a favor, and watch literally any film that the director made because he wanted to share something significant. Don't watch this product that came from a complacent Hollywood has-been, surrounded by yes-men, resting on his laurels, and churning out an insulting imitation of his earlier work.
