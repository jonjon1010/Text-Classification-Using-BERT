t is funny that nowadays vilains are usually big corporations run by white men.

Oh, well... For the lack of a better idea of because of laziness on the writer's part we have another film where the main vilain is yet again, you guessed, a big evil tech corporation. Of course, they are after our gargantuan but friendly canine. Haven't we seen this same plot millions of times before? If we substitute the companionable pooch by a cute alien, a kid with some special power, bigfoot's offsprings, a unfrozen caveman, a misplaced baby dinosaur, etc. The story is still the same.

What is even funnier is that Holywwod itself is composed by a large number of evil coporations run by very rich white men.

All in all, Clifford lacks everything even remotely related to originality.

I guess it is an OK film for a not-so-demanding four-year-old child.
