Edgar Wright's latest, Last Night in Soho, is about reality versus fantasy. Dream-state versus wake-state. It is about personality traits passed from mother to daughter. It's about mean girls. Also mean men. It sympathizes with the innocent. It makes us rethink who or what is truly guilty. It is a mystery. A Who Done it. And, in fact, someone actually did do / done it. Or ... did they? Or are we simply confusing fantasy with dreaming, confusing current reality with time passage. Or ... what?

An innocent young woman is accepted by a London Fashion Academy. Once in London her life takes her to a rooming house and once there, takes her back and forth between the dream state and reality, between the now and the then, between evil and good, the helpless and the not as helpless as you might think. You, the viewer, are free to interpret the film as you like. Me? I like a little help with my figuring out. And, if anything, the few attempts at illumination left me more in the dark.

I enjoy Edgar Wright's films; particularly Shawn of the Dead and Baby Driver. And a lot of people do and will enjoy this film. And enjoy this kind of film. And even if you don't, the film really looks great. So I'm giving it three '*'. But only for that; good looks.

And you know what thy say about 'only skin deep'.

Better keep that in mind.
