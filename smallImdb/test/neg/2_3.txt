I only watched this movie because my wife wanted a Christmas movie on Christmas. You could describe me as a grinch as I can't be bothered with those kind of holidays. But anyway I watched it, got bored after about five minutes, promised myself to sit through it and that's exactly what I did, sat through it. Okay the animation is well done, like almost any other animated movie I guess, but the story itself is just not my thing. The rhyming of Dr. Seuss might work for kids, but I'm not a kid and so I don't care. Benedict Cumberbatch, never been a big fan of him as an actor, and after The Grinch I will never be a fan of him narrating either. I thought I would be the only one who didn't like this movie but after reading the first page of reviews I guess we're plenty like me.
