I recall watching Rent on Broadway years ago, hence a movie about its creator would be a logical follow-up. TTB is certainly a well-made musical film but sorry - i am still struggling with the notion of casting Spider-Man in a musical. I am sure Garfield will get tons of awards for his singing and acting talents as will Lin-Manuel Miranda for his directorial debut, but I am going to rewatch the film version of Rent for nostalgia instead.
