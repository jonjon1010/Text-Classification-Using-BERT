The film had a basic start, they re-imagined the Stallone/Schneider dynamic from Judge Dredd (1995), which was a weird choice, but it was ok.

Ryan Reynolds played himself, the Rock projected his reluctance to get involved in this production. Gal Gadot was also there, and even after all these years, she still cannot act.

It felt like a generic adventure film for quite some time, until they gave up at the end and just started throwing stuff at you.

When the twist bombardment began I was just laughing cause I gave up trying to understand why anything in this film had to happen at all. I wasn't into the 'big stakes' from the beginning, and there wasn't anything mysterious about this, but in the end, everything was just rendered pointless.

There were two funny jokes, one good action shot at the beginning, everything else was supposed to work, but was indeed either CGI or green screen. So all the Indiana Jones-sy stuff (besides the crate reference) didn't feel at all, because it wasn't real-life.

They set up the sequel and the film will probably sell, but even as these mindless adventures go, in the end, this was a waste of time.

Mildly entertaining/no characters/no story/no attachment out of 10.
