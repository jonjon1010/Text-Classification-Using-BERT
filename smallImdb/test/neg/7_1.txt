Let's be completely honest with each other. Either you are a Disney nerd and everything they spit out is a golden turd or you are anti-crap and dislike when studios recycle, regurgitate the same CG, same script, same BS every few years. Like Disney does with its animated movies.

I bet they used a lot of the same animation/CG that they did in the Pirates of the Caribbean. The scary Spaniards are exactly like them, complete copies in every respect. The story is also very similar to the Fountain of Youth from Pirates of the Caribbean. The surface has changed, but everything underneath the hood is the same.

The casting is OK, the acting is childish, the script is meh. The movie is completely predictable. I became bored within a few moments, but tried to stay with it. The family enjoyed it. Silly, childish fun.

I didn't care for it. I ended up stopping about half way.

If you aren't looking for much in quality, then this might be your thing.
