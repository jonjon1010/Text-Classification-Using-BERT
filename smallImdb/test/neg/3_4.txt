This is about a grown man who think he is an elf. Come on. Why do people like this movie. This is a 6.9. This is a 4. Come on. The story line awful. I was going skip this movie. But then people to say it was good movie. And it is about a grown man who think he is an elf. How stupid does a comedy movie have to be before people wake up realize they have been ripped off. Do not waste your time. And do not waste your money. What is your first clue that this is an awful movie. It is about a grown man who thinks he is an elf. Please. What is it with people do they have to think ever comedy movie ever made is funny? Do they have to like every comedy ever made.
