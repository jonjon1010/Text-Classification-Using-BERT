Ridley Scott thinks this film was a failure at the box office because of phones. He's wrong. It's a failure because he managed to make a long, boring movie from a long, boring script mansplained together by two Boston Bros (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), who clearly wanted to be patted on the back for writing something "sensitive" about the plight of women 'way back in the past, back when you could write about such stuff without having to worry about it affecting the bottom line of your movie.

It left me pondering *not* the mysteries of Me, Too but greater questions, like "Why oh why is Adam Driver a movie star?" or "How can Ben Affleck become even ickier than usual, simply by 'going blond'?" or "Which is a greater failing, Matt Damon's inability to grow facial hair, or his inability to act?" The only thing that enabled me to get through the movie was Jodie Comer.
